    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a witch.
    Panel 1.
    The witch is in her hut walking away from a shelf with a demon skull on it.
    Skull: Mistress, your Hexizon package has arrived.
    Witch: Good. I'm going to grab it before it gets stolen again.
    Panel 2.
    Close up on the witch poking her head out her front door calling to the package like you would a pet.
    Witch: Here package package package.
    Panel 3.
    We zoom out and the witch is glaring angrily at a pair of alarmed looking gnomes carrying off a package with "Hexizon" written on the size.
    Witch: Hey! So you're the ones who've been stealing my packages! You gnomes just messed with the wrong witch.
    Panel 4.
    The gnomes are frantically fleeing with the package, pursued by the witches hut which has sprouted chicken legs and is stomping after them. The witch is leaning out a window cackling gleefully and shooting spells at them.
