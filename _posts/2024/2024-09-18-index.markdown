    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    A man with long hair, a beard, and glasses (Programmer) is talking to a woman with glasses and a ponytail (Hannah) in an office. Hannah is looking thoughtful.
    Programmer: Characters in Greek myths are such idiots. They constantly fail the simplest of trials. Don't open this box. Don't look behind you. Easy stuff.
    Panel 2:
    Hannah: You think you could do better?
    Programmer: Of course.
    Panel 3:
    Subtitled "The next day..." Hannah is walking away from Programmer who is holding a box.
    Programmer: You're a MONSTER!
    Hannah: Hahahaha! Good luck.
    Panel 4:
    We zoom in on programmer who is angrily looking at the box titled "Pandora Cookies. Forbiddenly Delicious."
    Programmer: Dammit!
