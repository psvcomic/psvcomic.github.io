alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a witch talking to an employee in a tech store.
    Panel 1.
    The witch is holding up a skull with fangs and a pentagram on its forehead. The pentagram has been disrupted.
    Witch: I need a new demon skull. The seal on this one got scuffed and the demons escaped.
    Employee, distressed: Is there anyway  I could convince you to get a smart phone instead?
    Panel 2.
    Witch: Hm... do they grant access to vast stores of knowledge.
    Employee: Yes.
    Panel 3.
    Witch: Are they full of tiny demons trying to barter pieces of your soul for their meagre services?
    Employee: Basically.
    Panel 4.
    Witch: Do they work in the middle of the woods?
    Employee, resigned, pulling a bloody battle axe out from behind their desk: *sigh* I'll go warm up the pentagram.
