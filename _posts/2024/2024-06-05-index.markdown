    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    A man with messy hair (Jim) is looking up and gesturing.
    Jim: Capitalism Dragon, why must we sacrifice ourselves on your altar?
    Panel 2.
    We zoom out to see a dragon standing before a cliff with an alter where people are sacrificed to it. Jim can be seen standing before it.
    Dragon: So that your kind may look upon my shining scales and glittering hoard and dream of one day being as I am.
    Panel 3.
    We zoom back down to Jim.
    Jim: But those are just dreams. I'm never going to actually be a dragon.
    Panel 4.
    We zoom back out.
    Dragon: ...Get on the altar.
