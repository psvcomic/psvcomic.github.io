    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a witch flying on a broom.
    Panel 1.
    The witch is flying through the starry night sky.
    Witch, happily: There's nothing quite like flying through the sky at night.
    A whirring sound intrudes on the bottom right of the panel.
    Panel 2.
    We zoom out a bit to see a 4 propeller drone flying near the witch. She glares at it angrily.
    Panel 3.
    The witch zaps the drone with magic and an explosion blasts off three of it's propellers.
    Panel 4.
    The witch flies off looking happy. A crash down emanates from the bottom left on the panel.
