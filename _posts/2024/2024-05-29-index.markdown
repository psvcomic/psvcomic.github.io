title: Old Man Yells At Emoji
alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring an old man with a cane (Programmer) and a man with messy hair (Jim).
    Panel 1.
    Programmer: Dang kids and your emoji.
    Jim: What's the matter old man. Afraid of pictograms infiltrating language?
    Panel 2.
    Programmer: What?! No! We've been doing that since the emoticon days. It's the implementation! The Unicode definitions for emoji are too vague to consistently convey meaning across font families!
    Panel 3.
    Programmer, leaning in to make a point: Which would be fine if messages were rendered with the emoji font they were written it. But they're not! Most modern messaging apps make no such guarantee when crossing operating systems.
    Panel 4.
    Programmer is gesticulating to Jim in the background while a woman and her child walk by in the foreground.
    Programmer: It's like writing a message in Wingdings and reading it in Webdings! it's madness!
    Child: Mom, what's wrong with that man?
    Mom: That's a software engineer Jimmy. Try not to stare.
