alttext: |-4 
    A 6 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring the Star Wars character Mon Mothma rendered with a moth's head, wings, and hands, the frog like alien Admiral Akbar, and the lion like alien Councillor Fey'lya.
    Panel 1.
    A title card reads "Mon Mothra Adventures" with an episode title "Grow Up". Mon can been seen face palming in embarrassment as Fey'lya and Akbar fight like children in the background.
    Panel 2.
    Fey'lya and Ackbar are petitioning Mon in the council chamber looking petulant.
    Fey'lya: Mon, Admiral Ackbar isn't doing things the way I would do things.
    Akbar: Mon, Councillor Fey'lya is undermining my authority as head of the military.
    Mon, angrily: Rrrrrrrr! ENOUGH!
    Panel 3.
    Mon is glaring down at Ackbar and Fey'lya.
    Mon: This is a government! Not a daycare for whiny children!
    Fey'lya: But Mon...
    Mon, cutting him off: NO BUTS!
    Panel 4.
    A further close up as Mon gets in their startled faces.
    Mon: Either you two learn to resolve your differences like grownups, or you will join Mr. Solo in...
    Panel 5.
    Extreme close up on Mon glaring.
    Mon: THE COCOON.
    Panel 6.
    Subtitled: Earlier. Mon is glaring angrily at a cocoon.
    Cocoon: This is demeaning.
    Mon: This, Mr. Solo, is how I became an adult. If it worked on me, maybe it will work on you.
