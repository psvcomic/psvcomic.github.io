title: Praise Gogorthoblek
alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    We are zoomed in on a hooded figure wearing an eye amulet (Cultist). They carry a forked staff with a dark eye hovering over it and tendrils dangle from the dark void of the hood.
    Cultist, their words wavy and weird: You are but ants caught in the jaws of beings beyond your comprehension indifferent, or actively hostile, to your very existence.
    Panel 2.
    We see that Cultist is talking to 3 young people (Jane, Joe, and Jim) on a beach.
    Jim: Yeah, we know. The modern world sucks!
    Joe: My every action and word are recorded by unseen forces for uncertain reasons.
    Jane: This rectangle makes me miserable, but I can't stop looking at it!
    Panel 3.
    Cultist, gesticulating: You misunderstand. When Dread Gogorthoblek awakens from their slumber they will feast upon your very world!
    Panel 4.
    Jim: Eh, it's that or wait for climate change to do us in.
    Joe: None of us can afford to retire anyway.
    Jane: At least my landlord will get what's coming to him.
