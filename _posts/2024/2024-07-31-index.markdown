    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a man with messy hair (Jim) and a man with long hair, a beard, and glasses (Programmer).
    Panel 1.
    Programmer is handing Jim a phone.
    Jim: Did you figure out what's wrong with my phone?
    Programmer: Bad news. Your phone is haunted.
    Panel 2.
    Jim, surprised: Haunted?!
    Programmer: Yup. I pulled every log. Ran every test. And consulted with every expert. We all agreed the only explanation is malevolent spirits.
    Panel 3.
    Jim, despairing: So it's stuck like this?
    Programmer, handing Jim a piece of paper: Fear not. Follow these instructions EXACTLY and that should fix it.
    Panel 4.
    Jim: That's... a lot of goat's blood.
    Programmer: And pay close attention to the moon phase. Even a day or two off could make things a lot worse.
