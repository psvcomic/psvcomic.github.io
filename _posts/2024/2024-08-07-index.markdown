    A three panel black, white, and grey comic. The top panel is double wide.
    Panel 1.
    A dragon sits atop it's hoard surrounded by clouds.
    Dragon: My horde is vast and the humans hurl themselves at my feet, prostrate in reverence. These are the dreams of dragons. And yet...
    Panel 2.
    We zoom in on the dragon's face as they scratch their chin contemplatively.
    Dragon: Deep within me there is a void. An... emptiness.
    Panel 3.
    Remaining zoomed in, the dragon huffs angrily.
    Dragon: I need MORE!!!
