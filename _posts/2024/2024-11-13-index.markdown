title: Consume or be Consumed
alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    A woman with wavy hair (Jane) is gesturing questioningly.
    Jane: Capitalism Dragon, what will happen when machines and AI eliminate the need for most human labour?
    Panel 2.
    We zoom out to a dragon in front of a cliff with an alter where people are sacrificed to it. Jane can be seen standing there.
    Dragon: The order of things will remain unchanged. The rich shall luxuriate. The useful shall toil. The rest shall be consumed.
    Panel 3.
    We zoom back in on Jane.
    Jane, hopefully: I think you meant to say "cared for." Riiiiight?
    Panel 4.
    We zoom back out to the dragon.
    Dragon, bluntly: No.
