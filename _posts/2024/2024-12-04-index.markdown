    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    A man with messy hair (Jim) is talking to a woman with glasses and a ponytail (Hannah) who is siting at a computer.
    Jim, delighted: I can't believe how many cool websites and games you can access for free!
    Hannah: Have you read the terms of service?
    Jim: Of course not!
    Panel 2.
    Close up on Hannah looking intensely into Jim's startled eyes.
    Hannah, concerned: YOU FOOL!!! If you aren't paying for the product you are the product! You don't know what you've given away!
    Panel 3.
    One week later there is a knock at Jim's door. He is approaching it with a quizzical look. Through the door's windows we can see a boxy silhouette with antennae.
    Panel 4.
    The door has been opened to a robot carrying a chain saw.
    Robot, delighted: Hello! I've come to collect your skeleton.
    Jim, distressed: But I'm still using it.
    Robot: Not according to our terms of service!
