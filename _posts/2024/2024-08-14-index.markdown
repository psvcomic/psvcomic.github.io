    A title card reads "Mon Mothra Adventures: Lightsaber"
    Panel 2.
    A pair off rebel pilots are talking in a cafeteria.
    Pilot 1: So, I've been reading regulations. Did you know there's an explicit ban on activating lightsabers on rebel bases?
    Pilot 2: Weird. Who even has one of those?
    Panel 3.
    We zoom in on Pilot 1.
    Right? But every rule has a story behind it. I wonder what happened to create this one.
    Panel 4.
    Subtitled "Earlier..."
    We cut to a scene where Luke Skywalker is holding an active lightsaber and trying to hold off Mon Mothra who is reaching for it, wide eyed.
    Luke: Mon, no! It's dangerous!
    Mon: SSSOOOO BBRRRIIIIIIGGHHTT!!!
