    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a man with a white, well groomed moustache and beard (Richman).
    Panel 1.
    Richman is sitting up, bleary eyed, in bed. A ghost wrapped in chains is approaching.
    Ghost: OoOoOo... Richman. This Christmas you will be visited by...
    Richman, yawning: Oh great. Another one. Which are you? Business partner? Friend? Family?
    Panel 2.
    Ghost, taken aback: Don't you recognize your old frie...
    Richman, bored: You know what? I don't care.
    Richman snatches a remote from his night stand and clicks it.

    The ghost cries "NOOOOOOO" while being sucked down into a column of light. Richman squints against the brightness.
    Panel 4.
    Richman is now dressed in fancy cloths. He's handing a techy looking box to his butler in front of some windows.
    Richman: Caught another well-wishing spirit last night.
    Butler: Ah, and what shall I file this one under?
    Richman: Oh, just shove it wherever.
    Butler: Very good sir.
