title: How to Change a Government
alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a robot and a man with long hair, a beard, and glasses (Programmer).
    Panel 1.
    The robot approaches Programmer who is sitting at a computer.
    Robot: Do you truly fear your human government will become a dictatorship.
    Programmer: I sure do.
    Panel 2.
    Close up on Programmer.
    Programmer: A government is just a machine made of people. If you can replace enough of those people you can change what the machine does.
    Panel 3.
    We zoom back out.
    Robot, looking horrified: That's terrifying!
    Programmer: Yup.
    Panel 4.
    Robot, looking grossed out: How is the machine built? Are the bones fused or is this more of a slurry situation?
    Programmer, surprised: Oh, nothing like that! Though many politicians do seem to be missing their spines...
