alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring the Star Wars character Mon Mothma drawn with moth wings, a moth head, and insect hands.
    Panel 1.
    A title card reads "Mon Mothra Adventures: Shopping Around"
    Panel 2.
    We open on a close up of Mon chewing on something with a fork in her claw.
    Mon: Mph. This one's a little chewy.
    Panel 3.
    Mon, thoughtfully: This one's better, but the flavour is a little chemically. Do you have anything made with more natural dyes?
    Panel 4.
    We zoom out to see Mon Mothra is sitting at a table with Admiral Ackbar.
    Ackbar: I don't think these are the criteria we should be using to pick uniforms.
    Mon: Shut it Ackbar. Let me have this.
