    Bear: Been workin' this bear nearly 40 years. Seen some things.
    Panel 2.
    The bear looks down at it's notebook.
    Bear: It weighs a bear down. The wear and grind. The slow descents. The fast tragedies. World ain't as dark as we paint it but you know what they say. If it bleeds it leads. Job's a job.

    The bear looks up pensively.
    Bear: Tried writing some good news once. Didn't work. Couldn't make the words fit.
