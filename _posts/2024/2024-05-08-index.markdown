title: Stress Free
alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    We are zoomed in on a squirrel.
    Squirrel: You humans are strange creatures. Always stressed. Scurrying about helter skelter in your "rat race."
    Panel 2.
    Squirrel: We squirrels are your opposite. Our lives are simple and stress free. Gather food. Sleep in tree. Forget where you put most of the food. It is a life of leisure.
    Panel 3.
    We zoom out a bit and now see a hawk swooping in to grab the squirrel.
    Squirrel: Look upon me human. Look upon a creature more relaxed than you can ever hope to be.
    Panel 4.
    A happy hawk is carrying the squirrel away in its talons.
    Squirrel: Even in this moment, I am zen.
