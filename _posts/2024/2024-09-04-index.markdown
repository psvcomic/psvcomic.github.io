    A 5 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    A man with messy hair (Jim) is talking to a man with long hair, a beard, and glasses sitting at a computer (Programmer 1).
    Jim, frustrated: I can't believe people are still trying to make Blockchains happen!
    Programmer 1: Ugh. Same. But this makes more sense when you understand programmers are drawn to two things.
    Panel 2.
    Heading: Clever solutions...
    A woman with a ponytail and glasses (Programmer 2) is talking to Programmer 1.
    Programmer 2: IF we take all those 1s and 0s and mash them together in a deterministic way we can use small amounts of data to verify the integrity of large amounts of data! (This is called a Hash)
    Programmer 1: Brilliant.
    Note: This is called a Hash.
    Panel 3.
    Heading: ...and stupid solutions.
    Programmers 1 & 2 are still talking.
    Programmer 1: What if we just rolled truly, catastrophically large dice? The probability of rolling the same number twice would be so low we could assume it's never going to happen! (This is called a GUID)
    Programmer 2: That's just crazy enough to work!
    Note: This is called a GUID.
    Panel 4.
    Cut back to Programmer 1 and Jim.
    Programmer 1: Blockchains require doing a lot of clever things to make something very stupid. They draw us in like moths to a flame!
    Panel 5.
    Jim: Wait... so is AI...
    Programmer 1: Yes. A very clever way to render a koala with two butts.
