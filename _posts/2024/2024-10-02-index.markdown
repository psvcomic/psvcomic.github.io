    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a witch and a man with messy hair (Jim). The two are in the witches hut in front of a window looking out on the night sky. Below the window is the witch's cauldron.
    Panel 1.
    The witch is holding a broom.
    Witch: This enchanted broom can sweep my hut all on its own!
    Jim: Sweet! Just like those fancy vacuums!
    Panel 2.
    The witch is holding a skull with fangs and a pentagram on its forehead.
    Witch: This possessed demon skull gives me access to knowledge both ancient and arcane.
    Jim: Wow! Just like Wikipedia.
    Panel 3.
    The witch is holding a sphere with starlight swirling inside. Jim is looking at his phone.
    Witch: With this orb I can contact my sisters across vast distances.
    Jim: That reminds me, I owe my parents a video call.
    Panel 4.
    The witch is gesturing angrily.
    Witch, frustrated: My hut can sprout chicken legs and roam the country side!
    Jim, sad: Oh. I live out of my van too.
    Witch: GRRRRR! Just be amazed damn you!
