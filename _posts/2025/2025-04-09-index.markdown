    A black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    In the foreground is a man wearing a helmet with a clock on it and the words "Time Force" written on their vest. In the background is a desk with a picture of a family on it and a clock.
    Cop: Being a time cop isn't for the faint of heart. Time criminals are a special breed of messed up.
    Panel 2.
    Cop, leaning in: Before you put them away some future version of them that already served their time is working to undo the whole thing.
    Panel 3.
    Close up on the cop. As the panel moves from left to right their face is gradually transitioning to that of a clowns.
    Cop: Your entire life might be rewritten for reasons you don't understand and you won't even know it happened.
    Panel 4.
    We now see a clown standing outside of a tent holding a bunch of balloons he's handing towards a child. Across from him is the child, reaching for the balloons, and his mother.
    Clown, cheerfully: Anyway, want a balloon kid?
    Kid, enthusiastically: Yeah!
