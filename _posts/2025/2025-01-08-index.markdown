    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    We are close up on a moth's face at night.
    Moth: For centuries we moths have fought a ware against night time glowies. The lights that defile the sanctity of these nocturnal hours with their brightness.
    Panel 2.
    We zoom out a little and can see that the moth is talking to a few other moths.
    Moth: Tonight we bring that fight to our most ancient enemy! The ultimate glowy!
    Panel 3.
    We pull out even more to see the moth is speaking to a whole host of moths. The moon shines above.
    Moth: THE MOON!!!
    Panel 4.
    We pull back as an army of moths flies into the air.
    Moth: CHARGE!!!
