    Panel 1.
    Crab, excited: Mighty Propheseel, tell me my future!
    Eel: I see you within the halls of power surrounded by luxury.
    Panel 2.
    Crab, skeptical: Wait... this is one of those ironic fates isn't it. I'm going to be eaten by rich people or something.
    Eel: No. You will not be eaten.
    Panel 3.
    Close up on the crab.
    Crab, excitedly: Sweet! I'm gonna be rich!

    Cut to a pair of rich people sitting at a table, their plates empty. In the foreground we see the crab dead on a plate.
    Opulady: I'm stuffed! I couldn't eat another bite.
    Richman: Indeed. Jeeves, throw the rest away!
