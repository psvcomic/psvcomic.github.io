    A 6 panel black, white, and grey comic set in a cubicle and featuring a man in a suit (manager) and a man with glasses, long hair, and a beard (Programmer).
    Panel 1.
    Programmer is sitting at his desk which has a computer monitor on it as well as a potted plant and a 20 sided die. Manager enters.
    Manager, cheerily: Hey, how would you like to take on a new cutting edge project?
    Programmer: No can do. I rolled a 1 today.
    Manager: ...what?
    Programmer: Programmers run on RPG rules. As you can see, today I rolled a 1. You'll have to find someone else.
    Panel 2.
    We cut to a close up, top down view of the die on the desk, showing a 1. There are cut outs showing Manager and Programmer in the top right and bottom left panels respectively.
    Manager, skeptical: This sounds like a ploy to avoid work.
    Programmer: Noooo. This has nothing to do with the project requirements being an unhinged nightmare.
    Panel 3.
    Cut back out to Manager and Programmer.
    Manager, cheerily: Well, it's a good thing I took the Inspiring Manager feat which gives you advantage on your check.
    Panel 4.
    Close up on Manager and Programmer's faces. Manager glares knowingly while Programmer looks surprised.
    Manager: Roll it again.
    Panel 5.
    But back to the top down view of the desk. This time the die has rolled a 20.
    Manager: Ha ha! A natural 20! I knew you had it in you!
    Programmer, distressed: Oh no.
    Panel 6.
    Manager is leaving looking pleased while Programmer has lifted the die and is glaring at it.
    Manager: That means you'll have it done by end of day!
    Programmer, angrily: Traitor!
