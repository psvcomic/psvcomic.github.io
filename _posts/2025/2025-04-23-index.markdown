    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a man with long hair, a beard, and glasses (Programmer) and a cat.
    Panel 1.
    Close up on Programmer standing in front of a couch. The cat can been seen sleeping happily behind him.
    Programmer: When I started making these dumb comics I set myself the goal of posting one comic a week for a year. That was one year ago. So...
    Panel 2.
    Zoom out to show balloons are attached to the couch. A sign is hung above it that reads "I did it!" Programmer blows a kazoo, startling the cat awake. The sound effect just reads "KAZOO!!!"
    Panel 3.
    Zoom back in on Programmer who is staring intently at the kazoo. The cat can be seen angrily beginning to pounce in the background.
    Programmer: I wasted a surprising amount of time trying to describe the sound these things make. It's not a honk exactly. But it is kind of a honk?
    Panel 4.
    Programmer lifts the kazoo higher. The cat begins it's pounce.
    Programmer: You are going to haunt me you strange plastic party favor. Anyway, the comic isn't going anywhere. I just wanted to mark the occasion.
