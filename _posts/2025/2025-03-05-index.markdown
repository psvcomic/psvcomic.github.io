    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a man in a monocle and top hat (Richman).
    Panel 1.
    Richman, dismissively: I'm perfectly happy for you to throw your little protest. Free speech and all that. I just don't want to hear you. Or see you. Or be inconvenienced in any way.
    Panel 2.
    Richman pulls out what looks like a garbage. On top is a boxy device with an on/off switch on the side and a slot on top. The word "Protests" written on it.
    Richman: So I created this handy box. If you are upset about something just write it down, put it in here, and I'll address it in due time.
    Panel 3.
    We zoom out to see Richman is talking to a group of angry young people. One of them shouts "That's a paper shredder!"
    Panel 4.
    We zoom back on Richman.
    Richman, evasively: ...No it isn't. It just makes... freedom noises.
