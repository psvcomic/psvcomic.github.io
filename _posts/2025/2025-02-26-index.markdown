alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    We are zoomed in on a squirrel holding a peanut.
    Squirrel: Owning a thing, this is an illusion. Ownership is not part of the fundamental state of the universe. It is merely a social agreement between you and your community.
    Panel 2.
    Squirrel: And if your community feels you own more than your fair share they can simply change the agreement.
    Panel 3.
    We zoom out to see a second squirrel looking at the first one eagerly.
    Second Squirrel: Sooo... can I have my peanut back?
    Panel 4.
    First squirrel: No.
    Second squirrel is exasperated.
