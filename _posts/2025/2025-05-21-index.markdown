    Programmer: Ah yes. September 9th, 1947.
    Panel 2.
    Close up on Programmer.
    Programmer, intense: The day the war began.
    Panel 3.

    Jane, unamused: The war?
    Programmer: Their tactics change. But the moths never forgive. And they never forget.
    Panel 4.
    Cut over to a moth sitting at another computer. A military logo containing stars and an angular pair of moth wings is visible in the background.
    Moth: Let's see how this code runs without a lock statement! Ha ha ha ha!
