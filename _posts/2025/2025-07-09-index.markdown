alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a man with a beard and a bow and arrow (Ranger), a woman in armor with a sword and shield (Warrior), and a person whose face is concealed within a cloak covered in stars (Mage). They are in a field fighting a dragon.
    Panel 1.
    The dragon is just visible off panel. Ranger and Warrior are engaged in combat with it while mage can be seen in the background looking at a flower.
    Ranger: MAGE! Are you going to help fight this dragon or not?!
    Panel 2.
    Cut to Mage discarding their flower and turning in surprise.
    Mage: Oh! Right! One missile coming up!
    Panel 3.
    Close up on Warrior who is blocking the dragon's fire with her shield.
    Warrior: It's a dragon! I don't think a level 1 Magic Missile spell is going to do it!
    Panel 4.
    Cut back to mage hefting a modern missile launcher and looking confused.
    Mage: Magic what now?
