    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a man with long hair, a beard, and glasses (Programmer). He is riding on a people mover with the words "The Time Line" printed on it at regular intervals.
    Panel 1.
    The walls are scratched and stained. Programmer is looking up at a crummy, torn sign that says 2025 with an arrow pointing backward.
    Programmer: Well 2024, you sucked. Good riddance to you.
    Panel 2.
    Close up on Programmer as he moves past the sign.
    Programmer: Here's to hoping 2025 is better.
    Panel 3.
    Programmer is now past the sign and squinting up at a dark haze near the ceiling.
    Programmer: Is that smoke?
    Panel 4.
    Programmer is fleeing backward away from a fire ahead. 2025 with an arrow pointing ahead is scratched into the wall.
    Programmer: Take me back! TAKE ME BACK!!!
