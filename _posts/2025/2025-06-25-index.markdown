    A 4 panel back, white, and grey comic.
    Panel 1.
    We see the silhouette of a raven landing on a power line next to another raven who is already sitting there.
    Raven 1, landing: There you are.
    Panel 2.
    We see the two ravens beside each other. Raven 2 is looking away from Raven 1.
    Raven 1: Whatcha' doin'?
    Panel 3.
    We zoom in on Raven 2.
    Raven 2, pensively: I'm despairing at a world beset by apes bent on their own destruction.
    Panel 4.
    Cut back out to the two ravens. Raven 2 had turned around.
    Raven 1: Wanna go bully tourists and steal their food?
    Raven 2: Yes. Yes I do.
