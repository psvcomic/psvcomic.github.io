title: "It's a Surprise"
alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a man wearing a top hat and monocle (Richman) sitting in a fancy chair beside a pile of jewels. A field is visible out a nearby window.
    Panel 1.
    Out the window we can see a construction worker carrying in something wrapped in cloth.
    Richman: Truth is I've been bilking this town for years.
    Panel 2.
    Out the window we can see two construction workers standing up the large, cloth wrapped object.
    Richman: There are so many tax incentives they're practically paying to work for me.
    Panel 3.
    Out the window the ropes holding the cloth on the object have been removed and a worker is pulling the cloth away.
    Richman: And the best part? I throw a paltry sum at a hospital and they think I'm some kind of saint!
    Panel 4.
    A guillotine is now visible out the window. A worker stands in front of it looking happy.
    Richman: They're setting up a tribute to my generosity right now. Suckers.
