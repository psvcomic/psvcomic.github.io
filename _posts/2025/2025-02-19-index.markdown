    A 6 panel black, white, and grey comic titled "Citizen Roomba Chapter 6: Justice".
    Panel 1.
    A man in a suite (Mayor) is standing at a lectern with a microphone. A city skyline is visible in the background.
    Mayor: "And that's why I've decided to pursue the exiting economic opportunity that allows Richman Sludge to dump sludge in our river.
    At the bottom we see the sound of an approaching Roomba followed by a light bump.
    Panel 2.
    We zoom back to see the mayor's lectern is on a street with a crowd in front of him. He's looking curiously at a Roomba at his feet.
    Mayor: What the... Where did you come from?
    Panel 3.
    A cop burst onto the scene.
    Cop: Caught you! Mr. Mayor, you're under arrest for failing to charge an adorable house hold appliance!
    Mayor: That isn't a crime.
    Panel 4.
    We zoom in on the cop as a second one leans in and whispers in his ear.
    Cop: Oh, right! Also we have proof you took bribes from Richman Sludge.
    Panel 5.
    The cop is escorting the mayor off panel. The Roomba sits quietly at the bottom.
    Mayor: And I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for that meddling vacuum!
    Cop: Yeah yeah. Move along buster.
    Panel 6.
    The Roomba starts moving again and the crowd burst into applause.
