alttext: |-4 
    A 4 panel black, white and grey comic.
    Panel 1: A man with long hair and a bear is gesticulating angrily.
    Man: I am a reservoir of arcane knowledge! I have witnessed things beyond the ken of man!
    Panel 2: The man glares intensely at his hands.
    Man: I have practiced the darkest arts. Done things unholy and unspeakable. These hands... these hands are stained!
    Panel 3: We see a different man with messy hair an a hoodie gesturing casually.
    Second Man: Dude, you're just a software engineer. You write extremely boring business tools.
    Panel 4: The first man is now at a computer and the second man is face palming.
    First man: I have stitched 3rd party systems together with monstrous thread. Rejoice in your innocence. Daylight savings time cannot hurt you.
