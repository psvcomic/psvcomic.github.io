        <description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A 4 panel black, white, and grey comic featuring a professor giving a presentation to his peers.
Panel 1.
The professor is standing beside a slide that reads &amp;quot;A Peer Reviewed Analysis of Santa&amp;quot;.
Professor: For over a century we have assumed that Santa rewards goodness. But the data proves this patently false.
Panel 2.
The slide has switched to a graph showing that number of presents received increases with wealth.
Professor: Across all age groups, we see that Santa rewards wealth. &amp;quot;Goodness&amp;quot; is barely a rounding error.
Panel 3.
We now see the professor viewed in a snow globe.
Professor: In fact, we see this pattern repeat across all morality. Moral actions can attract modest pro-social benefits. But the greatest rewards go to rich ass holes who eagerly burn orphans for fuel.
Panel 4.
We pull back to see Santa on a festive throne, surrounded by treasure, angrily gesturing at the snow globe. An elf stands beside him examining a piece of paper.
Santa: Randall, add that researcher to the &amp;quot;Naughty&amp;quot; list.
Elf: He works in academia sir. He&amp;#39;s already there.&quot; src=&quot;https://psvcomic.com/assets/images/comics/2024/12/18/FullComic.png&quot; /&gt;</description>

Raven: The forests burn and the oceans boil. You poison the air and choke the sea. It is never enough. In your hunger for more you wear the very earth to dust. As long as these shadows remain we all...
Panel 3.

Robot: Do you truly fear your human government will become a dictatorship.
Programmer: I sure do.
Panel 2.
Close up on Programmer.
Programmer: A government is just a machine made of people. If you can replace enough of those people you can change what the machine does.

Programmer: Yup.

Programmer 1: Ugh. Same. But this makes more sense when you understand programmers are drawn to two things.
Panel 2.
Heading: Clever solutions...
A woman with a ponytail and glasses (Programmer 2) is talking to Programmer 1.
Programmer 2: IF we take all those 1s and 0s and mash them together in a deterministic way we can use small amounts of data to verify the integrity of large amounts of data! (This is called a Hash)
Programmer 1: Brilliant.
Note: This is called a Hash.
Panel 3.
Heading: ...and stupid solutions.
Programmers 1 &amp;amp; 2 are still talking.

Programmer 2: That&amp;#39;s just crazy enough to work!
Note: This is called a GUID.
Panel 4.
Cut back to Programmer 1 and Jim.

Panel 2.
Jim, surprised: Haunted?!

Panel 3.
Jim, despairing: So it&amp;#39;s stuck like this?
Programmer, handing Jim a piece of paper: Fear not. Follow these instructions EXACTLY and that should fix it.
Panel 4.
Jim: That&amp;#39;s... a lot of goat&amp;#39;s blood.
Programmer: And pay close attention to the moon phase. Even a day or two off could make things a lot worse.&quot; src=&quot;https://psvcomic.com/assets/images/comics/2024/07/31/FullComic.png&quot; /&gt;</description>

Panel 3.
Mon, thoughtfully: This one&amp;#39;s better, but the flavour is a little chemically. Do you have anything made with more natural dyes?
Panel 4.
We zoom out to see Mon Mothra is sitting at a table with Admiral Ackbar.
Ackbar: I don&amp;#39;t think these are the criteria we should be using to pick uniforms.

Panel 1.
Jane: Why don&amp;#39;t you take selfies?
Programmer: I&amp;#39;m cursed.
Panel 2.
Programmer: I look normal in mirrors. But any time someone takes a picture of me my visage is replaced with that of some horrible ghoul.
Panel 3.
Jane: Mind if I try?
Programmer: Go for it.
Panel 4.
The two are looking at Jane&amp;#39;s phone.

The panel&amp;#39;s border is wavy like the edges of a cloud. A man with a top hat and monocle (Richman) is standing by a machine with a piece of paper taped to it that says &amp;quot;Money O Matic.&amp;quot;
Richman: Richman AI is proud to present the Money-O-Matic. We just feed other people&amp;#39;s work into the top here and cash comes spewing out the side!
Panel 2.
This panel&amp;#39;s edges are also wavy. A man in a beret and paint stained coat (Artist) is kneeling before Richman.
Artist, in despair: But I don&amp;#39;t want you to feed my work into your machine.
Richman: Too bad! This is completely legal and I don&amp;#39;t owe you a cent!.
Panel 3.
We see Richman sleeping in bed with thought bubbles indicating the previous two panels were his dream.
Richman, muttering happily: haha... stupid peasants... can&amp;#39;t stop me... so rich...
Voice from off panel: Sir! Sir, wake up!
Panel 4.
Richman is standing before a man in a suite (Lackey).
Richman: WHAT!
Lackey: It&amp;#39;s the Money-O-Matic sir! It&amp;#39;s consuming more cash than it creates!
Richman: You have your orders! Keep shovelling money and priceless artworks into the furnace until it works!.&quot; src=&quot;https://psvcomic.com/assets/images/comics/2024/07/03/FullComic.png&quot; /&gt;</description>

Panel 1.
Bear: Been workin&amp;#39; this bear nearly 40 years. Seen some things.
Panel 2.
The bear looks down at it&amp;#39;s notebook.
Bear: It weighs a bear down. The wear and grind. The slow descents. The fast tragedies. World ain&amp;#39;t as dark as we paint it but you know what they say. If it bleeds it leads. Job&amp;#39;s a job.
Panel 3.
The bear looks up pensively.
Bear: Tried writing some good news once. Didn&amp;#39;t work. Couldn&amp;#39;t make the words fit.
Panel 4.

Panel 1.
Programmer is sitting at a computer, gesticulating angrily while Jane stands in the background with a neutral expression.
Programmer: I can&amp;#39;t believe people are losing their minds over these LLMs! They so obviously have no idea what you&amp;#39;re actually saying.
Panel 2.
Programmer: You give them a task with a list of requirements and they&amp;#39;ll straight up ignore most of them. And when you point that out to get them back on track they start ignoring all your previous instructions.
Panel 3.
Jane: They sound exactly like those customers you complain about doing support for.
Programmer, turning in surprise: MY GOD! You&amp;#39;re right!
Panel 4.
We cut to a newspaper front page with the heading: BREAKING NEWS! AI FINALLY FINDS A USE CASE. What&amp;#39;s visible of the article body reads: &amp;quot;AI finally finds a use case, replacing not customer support, but the customers themselves.

We zoom back down to Jim.
Jim: But those are just dreams. I&amp;#39;m never going to actually be a dragon.

Panel 1.
Programmer: Dang kids and your emoji.
Jim: What&amp;#39;s the matter old man. Afraid of pictograms infiltrating language?
Panel 2.
Programmer: What?! No! We&amp;#39;ve been doing that since the emoticon days. It&amp;#39;s the implementation! The Unicode definitions for emoji are too vague to consistently convey meaning across font families!
Panel 3.
Programmer, leaning in to make a point: Which would be fine if messages were rendered with the emoji font they were written it. But they&amp;#39;re not! Most modern messaging apps make no such guarantee when crossing operating systems.
Panel 4.
Programmer is gesticulating to Jim in the background while a woman and her child walk by in the foreground.
Programmer: It&amp;#39;s like writing a message in Wingdings and reading it in Webdings! it&amp;#39;s madness!
Child: Mom, what&amp;#39;s wrong with that man?
Mom: That&amp;#39;s a software engineer Jimmy. Try not to stare.&quot; src=&quot;https://psvcomic.com/assets/images/comics/2024/05/29/FullComic.png&quot; /&gt;</description>

Panel 1.
We are zoomed in on a hooded figure wearing an eye amulet (Cultist). They carry a forked staff with a dark eye hovering over it and tendrils dangle from the dark void of the hood.
Cultist, their words wavy and weird: You are but ants caught in the jaws of beings beyond your comprehension indifferent, or actively hostile, to your very existence.
Panel 2.
We see that Cultist is talking to 3 young people (Jane, Joe, and Jim) on a beach.
Jim: Yeah, we know. The modern world sucks!
Joe: My every action and word are recorded by unseen forces for uncertain reasons.
Jane: This rectangle makes me miserable, but I can&amp;#39;t stop looking at it!
Panel 3.
Cultist, gesticulating: You misunderstand. When Dread Gogorthoblek awakens from their slumber they will feast upon your very world!
Panel 4.
Jim: Eh, it&amp;#39;s that or wait for climate change to do us in.
Joe: None of us can afford to retire anyway.

Panel 1.
Two hosts in suits, a man and a woman, are sitting at a news desk.
Man: Our top story tonight, Richman Electronics is in hot water after it was discovered their televisions sneak into customers&amp;#39; rooms at night and steal their blood.
Woman: We go to CEO Richard Richman for comment.
Panel 2.
A man with a bow tie, fancy suit, top hat, and monocle gestures dismissively.
Richman: We couldn&amp;#39;t possibly ship our TVs without the blood stealing feature. The prices would be too high. No one would be able to afford them!
Panel 3.
The camera has shifted back to the news man.
Man: Incidentally, our investigation shows that wages in your factories haven&amp;#39;t increased in over 50 years. Care to comment?
Panel 4.
Richman: Are you mad?! If we increased wages the TVs would be too expensive! No one would be able to afford them!
Over the course of the 4 panels the following news has ticked by.

We are zoomed in on a squirrel.
Squirrel: You humans are strange creatures. Always stressed. Scurrying about helter skelter in your &amp;quot;rat race.&amp;quot;
Panel 2.
Squirrel: We squirrels are your opposite. Our lives are simple and stress free. Gather food. Sleep in tree. Forget where you put most of the food. It is a life of leisure.
